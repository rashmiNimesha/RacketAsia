        <p>Badminton has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations in India and Greece, where a game called
            "battledore and shuttlecock" was played. </p>
        <p>The first badminton association was founded in England in 1893, and the first All England Open Badminton
            Championships were held in 1899. Over the years, badminton continued to grow in popularity, spreading to
            countries such as China, Indonesia, and Malaysia, where it became a national sport. In 1992, badminton
            became an Olympic sport,
            and today it is played by millions of people around the world at both amateur and professional levels. </p>
        <p> Badminton plays by two or four players on a rectangular court divided by a net by using racquets and a
            shuttlecock.</p>

        <!-- Court information -->
        <h3 id="court">Badminton court</h3>
        <div class="content-line"></div>
        <img class=" badminton-images" src="images/badminton-content-court.jpeg" alt="badminton court">
        <p>The playing field for badminton matches is a rectangular space that is either 13.4 meters long and 6.1 meters
            wide for the singles matches or 13.4 meters long and 8.23 meters wide for doubles matches.</p>
        <p>A net that spans the court's middle divides it into two sections. The in-bounds space for the shuttlecock to
            land during play is designated on the court by boundary lines. A badminton court's flooring is typically
            constructed of wood with a matte surface.</p>

        <!-- Rackets information -->

        <img class="badminton-images" src="images/badminton-content-shutt-racket.jpg" alt="badminton">
        <p>The main piece of equipment used to play badminton is a badminton racquet. It is a thin and made to make it
            easier for players to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into the court of their opponent.
            The handle, shaft, and head are just a few of the parts that make up a basic badminton racket.</p>
        <p>The handle that the player holds onto is called the handle, and it is typically lined with rubber. The
            racket's long,
            thin component called the shaft links the grip to the head. The component of the racket that makes contact
            with the shuttlecock is known as the head, and it is normally constructed from a frame and a string bed. The
            outermost part of the racket head is called the frame, and it is often constructed of thin metals.
            The strings are tautly strung to produce a hitting surface in the inner edge of the racket head, which is
            known as the string bed.
            The sizes of badminton rackets vary. The right racket should fit the player's own playing style and
            intellectual capacity, and it should also feel comfortable in their hands.</p>
        <p>Players cross the net by hitting shuttlecocks, generally referred to as shuttles, in badminton. The base and
            the feathers, which are its two primary components, are a tiny object with a cone-like shape.

            Usually, cork is used to make the shuttlecock's base. A player's racket is used to strike this part of the
            shuttlecock. An extremely thin coating of leather or plastic is placed over the base's other end, which has
            a cone-like form.

            Plastic and feathered shuttlecocks are the two primary variants. High-level events use feathered
            shuttlecocks because of their brand recognition for high accuracy. For casual play, plastic shuttlecocks are
            a preferred option because they are more cheap and durable.</p>

        <p>Two or four players, a badminton court, rackets, and a shuttlecock are required for a game of badminton.
            A serve is made to the other player or team by one player, who then hits the shuttlecock over the net to
            begin play.
            Following that, players alternately hit the shuttlecock back and forth over the net until one player is
            unable to return it or the shuttlecock lands beyond the court's bounds. When the shuttlecock landed on the
            opposing team's court or if the opposing team is unable to retrieve the shuttlecock, a point is awarded.
            The first person or team to reach 21 points, with a two-point advantage, wins.</p>
