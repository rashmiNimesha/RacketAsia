        <p>Table tennis, often known as (trademark) Ping-Pong, is a ball game played on a flat table split into two
            equal courts by a net fastened across its width in the middle. Its basic rules are identical to those of
            lawn tennis. The goal is to strike the ball so that it crosses the net and bounces on the other player's
            side of the table, where the other player cannot reach it or properly return it. The players' little rackets
            (bats or paddles) are used to swing the lightweight hollow ball back and forth across the net. The game is
            well-liked throughout the world. It is a highly structured competitive sport in the majority of nations,
            especially in Europe and Asia, particularly in China and Japan. </p>

        <p>Table tennis equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. The table is rectangular, 9 by 5 feet (2.7 by
            1.5 metres), its upper surface a level plane 30 inches (76 cm) above the floor. The net is 6 feet (1.8
            metres) long, and its upper edge along the whole length is 6 inches (15.25 cm) above the playing surface.
            The ball, which is spherical and hollow, was once made of white celluloid. Since 1969 a plastic similar to
            celluloid has been used. The ball, which may be coloured white, yellow, or orange, weighs about 0.09 ounce
            (2.7 grams) and has a diameter of about 1.6 inches (4 cm). The blade of a racket, or bat, is usually made of
            wood, is flat and rigid, and may be covered with a thin layer of ordinary stippled, or pimpled, rubber,
            which may be laid over a thin layer of sponge rubber and may have the pimples reversed. Whatever combination
            is used, each of the two sides of a paddle must be different in colour. The racket may be any size, weight,
            or shape.</p>

            alt="tabletennis">

        <p>According to ITTF rules, the playing area must be at least 14 meters (45.9 feet) long by 7 meters (23.0 feet)
            broad, with a minimum height clearance of 5 meters (16.4 ft). The minimum dimensions for wheelchair events
            are 8 m (26.2 ft) long and 6 m (19.7 ft) broad.</p>

        <p>A match consists of the best of any odd
            numbers of games, each game being won by the player who first reaches
            11 points or who, after 10 points each, wins two clear points ahead.When the server provides poor service,
            either player provides poor returns, or both players engage in a specific offense, a point is awarded (e.g.,
            touches the playing surface with a free hand while the ball is in play). Up until 10-all, service switches
            hands every two points before switching hands every point after that.</p>
        <p>The serve is delivered from behind the end of the table, with the server tossing the ball upward from the
            palm of the free hand and striking it as it descends, causing it to first bounce on the server's court
            before crossing the net and landing on the opponent's court. No spin may be applied to the ball by the
            fingertips during serving. It wasn't always like this. Particularly in the United States, finger spin
            developed to the point where professionals could offer unbeatable services, which led to the game's
            absurdity. In 1937, finger spinning was outlawed worldwide.</p>
        <p>The ability of one player to overcome another through carefully considered strategy is what attracts the
            attention of the audience. Some of the tactics that may be employed to assist the strategy intended include
            quickening the pace of the game, slowing it down, changing the direction of the ball or giving it variable
            spin or velocity, and using delicate drop shots over the goal when the opponent is out of position.</p>
        <p>At one point, slow or defensive play was so prevalent that it took an hour to decide a single point at the
            1936 World Championships in Prague. Play is currently limited. The match continues using the expedited
            system if a game is not finished after 15 minutes have passed since it started. After then, the server
            forfeits the point if the receiver returns the service and the next 13 strokes. Each point results in a
            change in the service.</p>
        <p>Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may
            be both men or both women or one of each.Women compete in world championships and all other organized events
            since the women's game is as well-structured as the men's around the world. In addition to being
            well-organized, table tennis is also quite popular as a recreational activity and is played in a variety of
            settings, including homes, game rooms, sports clubs, and even outdoors when the weather is calm.</p>
