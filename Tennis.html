        <p>Tennis has a long and rich history that dates back to the 12th century in France, where it was known as "jeu de paume," or "game of the palm." Initially, the game was played with the hand, but later, players began using gloves and paddles to hit the ball. In the 16th century, rackets were introduced, and the game began to take on its modern form. It was played in enclosed courts, with a net dividing the playing area. The game quickly gained popularity among royalty and the aristocracy, and it spread throughout Europe.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, tennis as we know it today began to take shape. The first tennis club was founded in Leamington Spa, England, in 1872, and the first Wimbledon Championship was held in 1877. The modern rules of tennis were established in 1924, and the first Davis Cup was played in 1900. Throughout the 20th century, tennis continued to grow in popularity, and new players emerged as stars of the sport. Some of the most famous players in history include Bill Tilden, Don Budge, Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, and Serena Williams.</p>
        <p>Today, tennis is played all over the world, and it is one of the most popular and widely watched sports. It has also become a highly competitive professional sport, with major tournaments such as the Grand Slam events, the ATP and WTA tours, and the Olympics.</p>

        <div class="content-line"></div>
        <img src="Images/tennisCourt.jpg" alt="tennis court">
        <p>A tennis court is a rectangular playing surface with a net dividing it into two equal halves. The standard dimensions of a tennis court are 78 feet (23.77 meters) in length and 36 feet (10.97 meters) in width for doubles matches, and 78 feet (23.77 meters) in length and 27 feet (8.23 meters) in width for singles matches. The net is suspended 3 feet (0.91 meters) high in the center and 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 meters) high at the posts on either side of the court.</p>
        <p>The playing surface can be made of various materials, such as clay, grass, or hard court (such as asphalt or concrete), and the type of surface can affect the speed and bounce of the ball. There are also different types of lines on the court that mark the boundaries and various sections of the court, such as the service lines, baseline, and sidelines.</p>

        <div class="content-line"></div>
        <img src="Images/tennisracketAndBall.jpg" alt="tennisRacketAndBall">
        <p>A tennis racket is a piece of sports equipment used by players to hit the tennis ball during a game. It is usually made of lightweight materials such as graphite, aluminum, or composite materials, and consists of a handle, shaft, and head. The head of the racket is strung with synthetic or natural gut strings, which are used to strike the ball and impart spin or power.</p>
        <p>Tennis balls are the small, lightweight balls used in a tennis game. They are typically made of rubber, with a felt covering that is either natural or synthetic. The standard size of a tennis ball is approximately 2.7 inches in diameter, and they are typically pressurized to maintain their shape during play. Tennis balls come in a range of colors, with yellow being the most commonly used in professional matches. The quality and condition of the tennis balls used can have a significant impact on the speed and bounce of the ball during play.</p>
        <p>In a tennis game, the player uses the racket to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court. The objective is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is unable to return it, thereby winning a point.</p>
    
        <h3 id="play">How to play Tennis</h3>
        <div class="content-line"></div>
        <p>Tennis is a sport that is played by two or four players (two players on each side of the court), using rackets to hit a small, felt-covered ball over a net and into the opponent's court. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to return it and to win points by forcing the opponent to make errors.</p>
        <p>Here are the basic steps to play tennis:</p>
        <p><ol>
            <li class="list2">Start by finding a tennis court and a partner to play with. You'll also need a tennis racket and tennis balls.</li>
            <li class="list2">Choose who will serve first by flipping a coin or playing rock-paper-scissors.</li>
            <li class="list2">The server stands behind the baseline at the back of the court and tosses the ball into the air, hitting it diagonally across the net and into the opponent's court. The ball must land within the service box, which is a rectangular area marked on the court.</li>
            <li class="list2">The opponent then has the opportunity to return the ball by hitting it back over the net, and the point continues until one player is unable to return the ball or hits it out of bounds.</li>
            <li class="list2">Points are scored when the opponent is unable to return the ball, hits the ball out of bounds, or commits a fault (such as touching the net with the racket or failing to serve the ball into the service box).</li>
            <li class="list2">Players switch sides of the court after every odd-numbered game (i.e. after the first game, the third game, etc.).</li>
            <li class="list2">The game is won by the player who reaches four points first and is ahead by at least two points (i.e. the score is 4-2 or 5-3, etc.). If the score reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is played to determine the winner of the set.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>These are just the basics of tennis, and there are many more rules and strategies involved in the game. If you're interested in learning more, consider taking lessons from a professional coach or practicing with more experienced players.</p>
